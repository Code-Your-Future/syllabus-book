Homework 2 (props & state)
--

- Get Areas Data from the API, display all Areas. On clicking an area, display the Organizations in that area.
- Allow users to add new Organisations in an Area
- Rules:
 - Use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
 - Create at least two components (Organisation and Area) to display the information.
 - Use ES6 syntax as much as possible (No vars, try using arrow functions, separate components in different files and import them etc...)
- Hints:
   - Use Fetch to load the api data - you can use `npm install` to include it in your project
   - Loading the api data should go into componentDidMount
- Bonus:
   - Read about react-router and try to use it in your app
