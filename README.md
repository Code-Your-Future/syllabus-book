# Introduction

This is the course material for [Code Your Future](http://codeyourfuture.co/), a
not-for-profit coding school for refugees.

During the course you will learn the whole web development stack, including HTML/CSS, JavaScript and backend technologies. Weâ€™ll complement the training with workshops on modern software methodologies and job interview practices.

Our 6-month web development programme follows the success of our affiliate organisation in Amsterdam, [HackYourFuture](http://hackyourfuture.net), where over 50% of the graduates have found technical jobs.
